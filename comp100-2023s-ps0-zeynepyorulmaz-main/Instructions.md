## Are we done yet?

After you link your account and accept this assignment, you are done with this lab, congratulations! You do not need to complete the following PART1 in the lab hours, however, it should be submitted through GitHub before Monday (**March, 13th 23:00**). We *highly* recommend you to stay in the lab and work on that part in case you have any questions.

### Submitting Assignments

After you complete the assignment, you need to submit it through GitHub. We will grade your assignments in your GitHub repositories. 


To submit your assignment, you need to click the Version Control icon from the left menu bar (2nd from the top). It will show the files you have changed. If you click `Commit & Push` button, it will push all of your changes to your GitHub repository. You need to do these steps to submit your assignments. You will notice that you cannot commit your assignment without a message. It is good practice to add a meaningful message to commits, not only for us but also for you to understand your code and the changes you have made. It is not necessary to finish the whole assignment before committing. It is okay to commit and push parts of the assignment multiple times, you can think of them as checkpoints. We will only grade the last commit before the deadline.


## PART1: Hello World!
### Deadline: March, 13th  - 23:00

The goal of this programming exercise is to make sure your python and numpy settings are correct, to get you more comfortable with using PyCharm, and to begin using simple elements of Python. Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out results (using the `print` operation) and the ability to store values in a variable so that the program can access that value as needed.

**Calculating the Area of a Circle**


Write a program that does the following in order:

1. Create a variable `r=2` as the radius of the circle.
2. Create another variable `pi=3.14` as the π value.
3. Print out the square of radius r.
4. Print out the circle of the area, π r<sup>2</sup> .

An example of the output your program should give is shown below.

```
r**2 = 4
pi*(r**2) = 12.56
```

Use PyCharm to create your program, and save your code in the file named 'main.py'. **Commit and Push** your work to the master branch with a meaningful commit message. Note that only your latest commit counts and it should be before the deadline. 

**Hints**

* To see how to use the `print` command, you may find it convenient to look at the [output](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3/Hello,_World) of the Python Wikibook. This will show you how to use print statements to print out values of variables.

* Reference the [basic math section](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math) of the Python Wikibook to read more about using basic mathematical operators in Python.

* Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in *a variable* (i.e., give it a name to which you can refer when you want that value). You may find it convenient to look at [the Variables and Strings section](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Variables_and_Strings) of the Python Wikibook.
